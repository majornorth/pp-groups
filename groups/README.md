This is my first pass at client-side prototyping with Meteor.js. It makes use of Meteor's routing capabilities in conjunction with templating and 'data' stored in variables to quickly build a high-fidelity user experience. Big thanks to Connor Sears and Alex Webster for providing incredibly polished and robust mobile styles and a meteor package to boot.
